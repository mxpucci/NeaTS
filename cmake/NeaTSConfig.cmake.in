Then, in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, add an installation rule and configure the config file:

```cmake
include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)

# Install headers (from your /include folder)
install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/
    DESTINATION include
)

# Export the NeaTS target
install(TARGETS NeaTS
    EXPORT NeaTSTargets
    INCLUDES DESTINATION include
)

# Generate and install the export file
install(EXPORT NeaTSTargets
    FILE NeaTSTargets.cmake
    NAMESPACE NeaTS::
    DESTINATION cmake
)

# Configure the NeaTSConfig.cmake file
configure_package_config_file(
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/NeaTSConfig.cmake.in
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/NeaTSConfig.cmake
    INSTALL_DESTINATION cmake
    NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO
    NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO
)

# Install package configuration files
install(FILES
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/NeaTSConfig.cmake
    DESTINATION cmake
)
